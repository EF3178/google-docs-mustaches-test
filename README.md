# google-docs-mustaches-test
I could not figure out how to use google-docs-mustaches library, so I decided to do the same but using directly google docs API.
This code will :
1) Copy a google docs file to a destination folder in Google Drive
2) Update the created file
3) Export the created file to pdf
